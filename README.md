## Task 1

My name is **Mohammad AbuMazen** I graduated from The University of Jordan in 2021 with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. Prior to this boot-camp, I completed a couple of online courses. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in Data Science. I'm impassioned in building artificial intelligence models using machine learning and deep learning techniques.



## Task 2

***A Good Developer Mindset***

 - In this century to be successful developer you must follow some rules and think with a simple out of the box ways for your codes.
 - The **main goal** of every software design is to be as easy as it can be to help users to solve their problems.
 - Unnecessary changes must be avoided so we don't creat complexity, unnecessary changes will increase defects in the software. 
 - The **Second goal** should be keeping the code base as small as possible to keep it readable by other developers.
 - Using the required technology or language to solve a specific problem will make a real difference in time and effort.
 - A *good developer* creates codes that are easy to shake out all the bugs, in the given deadline.
